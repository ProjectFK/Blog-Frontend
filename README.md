# About
This is the blog project of ProjectFK

This project meant to be a blog website for this team to show how we developed in this project as a team and individuals,
this is a bridging project to have and develop our ability to create our forum later as well.

This repository is the front end of the blog project, based on
- Html, css and javascript
- Vue.js
- CryptoJs

# Interesting Facts
1. I argued with the backend owner on how to do ajax for days... Since I don't want to use Jquery, as a noobon frontend,
websites told me to use XMLhttp(), but he says to use fetch()...
